<p>The figure on the right is a simple model to help you think about the
relationship between <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>. The sample is placed in a
rectangular cuvette (see photo) with a base that is 1 cm by 1 cm. Light
enters one side of the cuvette and exits the opposite side. We are
interested only in an infinitesimally thin cross-section parallel to the
base, as shown by the black lines on the cuvette and the box below the
cuvette. We let <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> photons enter
the left-side of the cuvette at the same time. As a photon moves from
left-to-right, its probability of being absorbed is set by the slider.
After <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> steps, the number of
photons that exit the cuvette on the right is <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span>. Values of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span> are included in the figure.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Set the type of visualization to “none”
and gather values of <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span> for
absorption probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(0.00\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(0.04\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.08\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0.16\)</span>, and calculate the transmittance for
each. Examine your data and identify any interesting patterns you see
between the probability of absorption and the value of <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span>. What is the largest and smallest
possible value for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> A cross-section plot shows those photons
not yet absorbed as they move from left-to-right through <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> equally spaced intervals. Before you
look at the cross-section plot, predict what you will see for absorption
probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(0.00\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.04\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.08\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0.16\)</span>. Check your predictions by examining
the cross-section plots.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> If you count the number of photons in
each of a cross-section plot’s equally spaced intervals—Don’t try this
as the points are too small!—then you can plot the number of photons as
a function of the distance, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>,
traveled; this is a <span class="math inline">\(P(d)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> plot. Before your look at these plots,
make a prediction about the shape of the plot for absorption
probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(0.00\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.04\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.08\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0.12\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0.16\)</span>. Check your predictions by examining
the <span class="math inline">\(P(d)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> plots.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Set the absorption probability to <span class="math inline">\(0.08\)</span> and examine the <span class="math inline">\(P(d)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> plot. The first four values of <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(920\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(846\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(779\)</span> (rounded to the nearest integer).
Show that these values of <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span> are
correct.</p>
