<h4>Deriving Beer’s Law (<span class="math inline">\(A = a B
C\)</span>)</h4>
<p>The figure on the right shows a three-dimensional view of light as it
passes through a solution. Light enters from the left with a power of
<span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and exits from the right with a
power of <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span>. We can imagine an
infinitesimally thin cross-section of thickness <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>. The light’s power is <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> as it enters the cross-section and is
<span class="math inline">\(P - dP\)</span> as it exits the
cross-section. The fractional decrease in power, <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{dP}{P}\)</span>, is proportional to the
sample’s thickness, <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>, and to the
analyte’s concentration, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>;
thus</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[-\frac{dP}{P} = \alpha C dx\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a
proportionality constant. Integrating gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[- \int_{P = P_0}^{P = P_T} \frac{dP}{P}
= \alpha C \int_{x = 0}^{x = b} dx\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_T} \right) =
\alpha b C\]</span></p>
<p>Converting from <span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span> and substituting in <span class="math inline">\(A = -\log T = -\log \left( \frac{P_T}{P_0}
\right)\)</span> gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A = a b C\]</span></p>
<p>which is Beer’s law.</p>

<div id="is-absorptivity-given-as-a-or-as-epsilon" class="section level4">
<h4>Is Absorptivity Given as <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or
as <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span>?</h4>
<p>The most common expression of Beer’s law in most analytical chemistry
resources is <span class="math inline">\(A = \epsilon b C\)</span>
instead of <span class="math inline">\(A = a B C\)</span>. The
difference between representing absorptivity as <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or as <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is simply a convention
associated with units. As absorbance is a unitless number, the units of
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> depend on the units used for the
pathlength, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the analyte’s
concentration, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Pathlengths are
usually given in cm. When the analyte’s concentration is given in mol/L,
then the absorptivity is called the molar absorptivity and represented
using <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> with units of
cm<sup>–1</sup> M<sup>–1</sup>, and when the analyte’s concentration is
given in other units, such as ppm, then the absorptivity is represented
using <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> with units of
cm<sup>–1</sup> ppm<sup>–1</sup>.</p>

<div id="why-isnt-k-the-same-thing-as-probability" class="section level4">
<h4>Why Isn’t <em>k</em> the Same Thing as Probability?</h4>
<p>In defining models for transmittance, we described <em>k</em> as a
decay constant related to the probability that a photon is absorbed and
set that probability to 0.08. Modeling the data, however, gives values
for <em>k</em> of 0.0834, not 0.0800. Why? The reason is that we used
different equations to generate and to model the data. The data was
generated using the equation <span class="math inline">\(P(d) = P_0 (1 -
p)^d\)</span>, where <em>p</em> is the probability the photon is
absorbed in a particular increment, <em>d</em>. To model the data, we
used the equation <span class="math inline">\(P(d) = P_0
e^{-kd}\)</span>. Combining and simplifying these equations gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(1 - p)^d = e^{-kd}\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and simplifying gives
<span class="math inline">\(\ln(1 - 0.08) = -k\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(k = 0.08334\)</span>.</p>

<div id="is-it-ln-or-log" class="section level4">
<h4>Is it Ln or Log?</h4>
<p>You may have noticed when working on the Modeling Transmittance tab
that model <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and model <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> are defined in terms of the natural
(base <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>) logarithm, <span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span>, but the summaries of the models
appear to use the base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span>
logarithm, <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span>, instead of <span class="math inline">\(\ln\)</span>. This is an artifact of using <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> to build this learning modules. In
<span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, the natural logarithm is written
as <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span> and the base <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> logarithm is written as <span class="math inline">\(\log10\)</span>.</p>

<div id="power-vs.-intensity-vs.-number-of-photons" class="section level4">
<h4>Power vs. Intensity vs. Number of Photons</h4>
<p>Power, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, is energy per unit
time and intensity, <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, is power per
unit area. Although different measurements, they often are used
interchangeably; defining transmittance as either <span class="math inline">\(T = \frac{P_T}{P_0}\)</span> or as <span class="math inline">\(T = \frac{I_T}{I_0}\)</span> leads to the same
value for transmittance and, thus, absorbance. As power increases with
more photons, we can treat relative changes in power and intensity as a
measure of relative changes in the number of photons.</p>
