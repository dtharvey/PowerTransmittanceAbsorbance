#### Deriving Beer's Law ($A = a B C$)

The figure on the right shows a three-dimensional view of light as it passes through a solution. Light enters from the left with a power of $P_0$ and exits from the right with a power of $P_T$. We can imagine an infinitesimally thin cross-section of thickness $dx$. The light's power is $P$ as it enters the cross-section and is $P - dP$ as it exits the cross-section. The fractional decrease in power, $-\frac{dP}{P}$, is proportional to the sample's thickness, $dx$, and to the analyte's concentration, $C$; thus 

$$-\frac{dP}{P} = \alpha C dx$$

where $\alpha$ is a proportionality constant. Integrating gives

$$- \int_{P = P_0}^{P = P_T} \frac{dP}{P} = \alpha C \int_{x = 0}^{x = b} dx$$

$$\ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_T} \right) = \alpha b C$$

Converting from $\ln$ to $\log$ and substituting in $A = -\log T = -\log \left( \frac{P_T}{P_0} \right)$ gives 

$$A = a b C$$

which is Beer's law.

#### Is Absorptivity Given as $a$ or as $\epsilon$?

The most common expression of Beer's law in most analytical chemistry resources is $A = \epsilon b C$ instead of $A = a B C$. The difference between representing absorptivity as $a$ or as $\epsilon$ is simply a convention associated with units. As absorbance is a unitless number, the units of $a$ or $\epsilon$ depend on the units used for the pathlength, $b$, and the analyte's concentration, $C$. Pathlengths are usually given in cm. When the analyte's concentration is given in mol/L, then the absorptivity is called the molar absorptivity and represented using $\epsilon$ with units of cm^--1^ M^--1^, and when the analyte's concentration is given in other units, such as ppm, then the absorptivity is represented using $a$ with units of cm^--1^ ppm^--1^.

#### Why Isn't *k* the Same Thing as Probability?

In defining models for transmittance, we described *k* as a decay constant related to the probability that a photon is absorbed and set that probability to 0.08. Modeling the data, however, gives values for *k* of 0.0834, not 0.0800. Why? The reason is that we used different equations to generate and to model the data. The data was generated using the equation $P(d) = P_0 (1 - p)^d$, where *p* is the probability the photon is absorbed in a particular increment, *d*. To model the data, we used the equation $P(d) = P_0 e^{-kd}$. Combining and simplifying these equations gives 

$$(1 - p)^d = e^{-kd}$$ 

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and simplifying gives $\ln(1 - 0.08) = -k$, or $k = 0.08334$.

#### Is it Ln or Log?

You may have noticed when working on the Modeling Transmittance tab that model $2$ and model $3$ are defined in terms of the natural (base $e$) logarithm, $\ln$, but the summaries of the models appear to use the base $10$ logarithm, $\log$, instead of $\ln$. This is an artifact of using $R$ to build these modules. In $R$, the natural logarithm is written as $\log$ and the base $10$ logarithm is writen as $\log10$.

#### Power vs. Intensity vs. Number of Photons

Power, $P$, is energy per unit time and intensity, $I$, is power per unit area. Although different measurements, they often are used interchangeably; defining transmittance as either $T = \frac{P_T}{P_0}$ or as $T = \frac{I_T}{I_0}$ leads to the same value for transmittance and, thus, absorbance. As power increases with more photons, we can treat relative changes in power and intensity as a measure of relative changes in the number of photons.
