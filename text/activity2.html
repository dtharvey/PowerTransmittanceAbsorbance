<p>The figure on the right shows a plot of <span class="math inline">\(P(d)\)</span> vs. <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(P_0 = 1000\)</span> photons and for which the
probability that a photon is absorbed in each of <span class="math inline">\(50\)</span> increments in distance is <span class="math inline">\(0.08\)</span>. The shape of this data suggests we
can model the number of photons that remain at any distance, <span class="math inline">\(P(d)\)</span>, using an exponential decay:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{model 1: }P(d) = P_0
e^{-kd}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> is the initial number
of photons and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a decay
constant that is related to the probability that a photon is
absorbed.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Starting with the equation for model 1,
derive the equations below for model <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and for model <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, which are two other ways to express
the relationship between <span class="math inline">\(P(d)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{model 2: } \ln(P(d)) = \ln(P_0) -
kd\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{model 3: } \ln \left(
\frac{P(d)}{P_0} \right) = - kd\]</span></p>
<p>Leave the radio button for the type of model set to none and predict
the shape of a plot that places <span class="math inline">\(\ln(P(d))\)</span> (for model <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>), or <span class="math inline">\(\ln
\left( \frac{P(d)}{P_0} \right)\)</span> (for model <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>) on the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-axis and <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Click on the radio buttons for each
model and extract from the regression results values for <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For model <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, the values of <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> are in the model’s summary; for model
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and model <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, the value that appears below <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in the summary table is the slope of
the regression line. How do the three sets of estimates for <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> compare to each other? How do the three
sets of estimates for <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> compare to your expectations for their
values?</p>
