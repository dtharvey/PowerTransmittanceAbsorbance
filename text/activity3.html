<p>The absorbance, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, of light by
an analyte is a function of three variables: the analyte’s
concentration, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, the distance
light travels through the analyte’s solution, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and the analyte’s ability, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, to absorb light of a particular
wavelength; the last of these variables is the analyte’s absorptivity.
You can determine the relationship between these variables by examining
several sets of annotated cuvettes. The figure on the right provides a
key to interpreting these annotations. Note that each cuvette has a
fixed base that is <span class="math inline">\(b_1 \times b_1\)</span>
and a fixed pathlength of <span class="math inline">\(b_1\)</span> for
the side view; the top view has a variable pathlength equal to the
depth, <span class="math inline">\(b_2\)</span>, of solution in the
cuvette.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1.</strong> Use the pop-up menu to select Cuvette
Set <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Absorbance values—both when
looking through the cuvette from the side and from the top—are provided
inside the cuvettes; the shading of the sample’s color provides a visual
measure of relative absorbance. Use the data in this figure to determine
the proportional relationship between absorbance and path length in a
form such as <span class="math inline">\(A \propto b\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(A \propto b^{-1}\)</span>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2.</strong> Use the pop-up menu to select Cuvette
Set <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and determine the
proportional relationship between absorbance and concentration in a form
such as <span class="math inline">\(A \propto C\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(A \propto C^{-1}\)</span>, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3.</strong> Use the pop-up menu to select Cuvette
Set <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> and determine the
proportional relationship between absorbance and absorptivity in a form
such as <span class="math inline">\(A \propto a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(A \propto a^{-1}\)</span>, etc. Two of the
cuvettes have the same analyte as the other sets (shown in blue) and two
of the cuvettes have a different analyte (shown in orange). What are the
simularities and differences between the two analytes?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4.</strong> Using your results from Exercises <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>–<span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>,
write a single equation that expresses the absorbance as a function of
absorptivity, path length, and concentration; this equation is known as
Beer’s law.</p>
