<p><span class="math inline">\(\require{mhchem}\)</span>Colorimetry is
one example of a spectroscopic method of analysis. An early application
is Nessler’s method for ammonia, <span class="math inline">\(\ce{NH3}\)</span>, first introduced in the 1850s.
Nessler found that adding an alkaline solution of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{HgI2}\)</span> and KI to a dilute solution of
ammonia produced a yellow-to-reddish brown colloid in which the color
depended on the concentration of ammonia. By visually comparing the
color of a sample to the colors for a series of standard solutions of
<span class="math inline">\(\ce{NH3}\)</span>, Nessler was able to
determine the concentration of ammonia in the sample.</p>
<p>The figure on the upper-right illustrates Nessler’s method for
comparing the color of two solutions. Light passes through equal heights
of a sample and a standard, both in identical tubes. The analyst
observes the solutions by looking down and through them toward the light
source (the top view). To determine the analyte’s concentration, the
analyst exchanges the standard solution until the color of the sample
and the standard match.</p>
<p>The figure on the lower-right is a Spectronic 20D+, a simple
instrument that accomplishes the same thing as a pair of Nessler tubes.
A source of light passes through a monochromator that isolates a narrow
range of wavelengths that, in turn, pass through a cuvette holding a
sample or a reference blank. The Spectronic 20D+ measures the amount of
light from the source that enters the sample, <span class="math inline">\(P_0\)</span>, and the amount of light that emerges
from the sample, <span class="math inline">\(P_T\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is power. The ratio of the transmitted
power to the incident power is called transmittance, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[T = \frac{P_T}{P_0}\]</span></p>
<p>Although the instrument measures transmittance, we report the amount
of light absorbed, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, where</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A = -\log(T)\]</span></p>
